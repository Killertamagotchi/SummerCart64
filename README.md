## Help / Q&A

For any questions related to this project, please use [*Discussions*](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/discussions) tab in GitHub repository.
Using discussions tab is highly encouraged as it allows to have centralized knowledge database accessible for everyone interested in this project.

I'm also active at [N64brew](https://discord.gg/WqFgNWf) Discord server as `korgeaux` but keep in mind that [*Discussions*](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/discussions) tab is a preferred option.

## How do I get one?

One option is to ask in `#summer-cart-64` channel on [N64brew](https://discord.gg/WqFgNWf) Discord server if someone is making a group order.

If you want to order it yourself then I've prepared all necessary manufacturing files on the [PCBWay Shared Project](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/SC64_an_open_source_Nintendo_64_flashcart_14b9688a.html) site.

**Full disclosure**: for every order made through [this link](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/SC64_an_open_source_Nintendo_64_flashcart_14b9688a.html) I will receive 10% of PCB manufacturing and PCB assembly service cost (price of the components is not included in the split). This is a great way of supporting further project development.

**Be careful**: this is an advanced project and it is assumed that you have enough knowledge about electronics.
Selecting wrong options or giving PCB manufacturer wrong information might result in an undesired time and/or money loss.
Boards also come unprogrammed from the manufacturer - you need to do **initial programming step** yourself after receiving the board.
To avoid problems _**please**_ read **both** [build guide](./docs/06_build_guide.md) and description on the shared project page **in full**.
If you have even slightest doubt about the ordering or programming process, it is better to leave it to someone experienced - ask in the Discord server mentioned above if that's the case.

If you don't need a physical product but still want to support me then check my [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Polprzewodnikowy) page.

## Acknowledgement

This project wouldn't be possible without these contributions:

- [64drive](https://64drive.retroactive.be) orders being on permanent hold long before creating this repository.
- [EverDrive-64 X7](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x7.html) being disappointment for homebrew development (slow USB upload, unjustified price and overcomplicated SD card access).
- [Jan Goldacker (@jago85)](https://github.com/jago85) and his projects:
  - [Brutzelkarte](https://github.com/jago85/Brutzelkarte_FPGA) providing solid base for starting this project and sparking hope for true open source N64 flashcarts.
  - [UltraCIC_C](https://github.com/jago85/UltraCIC_C) reimplementation for easy integration in modern microcontrollers. Thanks also goes to everyone involved in N64 CIC reverse engineering.
- [N64brew](https://discord.gg/WqFgNWf) Discord server community being very helpful during flashcart development.
- [FatFs](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html) FAT32/exFAT library being easiest to integrate in embedded environment.
- [Yakumono's (@LuigiBlood)](https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood) extensive [64DD documentation](https://github.com/LuigiBlood/64dd/wiki) and its implementation in various emulators.
